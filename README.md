> # CSV Data Filtering App for Feeders
> This Android application allows filtering of data loaded from a CSV spreadsheet containing information about feeders, directions, structures, types, and distances (KM Local). Users can select a feeder, direction, enter a distance, and obtain filtered data based on these inputs.
>
> # Features
> CSV Data Loading: The app reads a CSV file located in res/raw/dados.csv, which includes the columns:
>
> - LDAT (Feeder)
> 
> - KM
>
> - Structure
>
> - Type
>
> - KM Local
>
> Feeder Selection Spinner: Users select a feeder from unique feeder options extracted from the spreadsheet.
>
> Direction Selection Spinner: After selecting a feeder, users choose the related direction dynamically populated based on the feeder.
>
> Distance Input: Users enter a numeric value for the distance to be used in filtering.
>
> Data Filtering:
>
> Results are filtered considering the feeder, selected direction, and entered distance.
>
> Only records where the KM Local value shares the same integer part as the input distance are displayed.
>
> Filtering accounts for direction to adjust the maximum distance calculation according to defined rules.
>
> # Project Structure
> MainActivity.kt: Contains the main logic for:
>
> - Loading and storing CSV data.
>
> - Populating the spinners with filtered options.
>
> - Executing data filtering based on user input.
>
> - Displaying filtered results.
>
> activity_main.xml: Layout with:
>
> - Spinner for feeder selection.
>
> - Spinner for direction selection.
>
> - Text input for distance entry.
>
> - Button to execute filtering.
>
> - TextView to display results.
>
> - dados.csv: CSV file containing spreadsheet data, placed inside res/raw/ folder.
>
> # How to Use
> 1. Clone or download the project and open it in Android Studio.

>
> 4. Select a feeder from the first spinner.
> 
> 5. Choose a direction from the second spinner, which updates automatically.
>
> 6. Enter a numeric distance value in the input field.
> 
> 7. Tap the Filter button to view data filtered according to your selections.
