> # CSV Data Filtering App for Feeders
> This Android application allows filtering of data loaded from a CSV spreadsheet containing information about feeders, directions, structures, types, and distances (KM Local). Users can select a feeder, direction, enter a distance, and obtain filtered data based on these inputs.
>
> # Features
> CSV Data Loading: The app reads a CSV file located in res/raw/dados.csv, which includes the columns:
>
> - LDAT (Feeder)
> 
> - KM
>
> - Structure
>
> - Type
>
> - KM Local
>
> Feeder Selection Spinner: Users select a feeder from unique feeder options extracted from the spreadsheet.
>
> Direction Selection Spinner: After selecting a feeder, users choose the related direction dynamically populated based on the feeder.
>
> Distance Input: Users enter a numeric value for the distance to be used in filtering.

> Data Filtering:

> Results are filtered considering the feeder, selected direction, and entered distance.

> Only records where the KM Local value shares the same integer part as the input distance are displayed.

> Filtering accounts for direction to adjust the maximum distance calculation according to defined rules.

> Project Structure
> MainActivity.kt: Contains the main logic for:

> Loading and storing CSV data.

> Populating the spinners with filtered options.

> Executing data filtering based on user input.

> Displaying filtered results.

> activity_main.xml: Layout with:

> Spinner for feeder selection.

> Spinner for direction selection.

> Text input for distance entry.

dados.csv: CSV file containing spreadsheet data, placed inside res/raw/ folder.

How to Use
Clone or download the project and open it in Android Studio.

Make sure the dados.csv file is located in the res/raw/ folder.
